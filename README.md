 📊 Sales Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes sales data from a retail business to uncover key insights, trends, and performance metrics. Using Python and its powerful data analysis libraries, we examine sales patterns, customer behavior, and regional performance to help drive business decisions.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Contents:** Transactional-level sales records including:
  - Order Date
  - Product Category & Sub-category
  - Region
  - Quantity, Sales, Profit
  - Discount
  - Customer and Segment details

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**
- **Excel** (initial exploration)
- *(Optional extensions: Power BI, Tableau, or Streamlit dashboard)*

## 📌 Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the sales data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify top-performing products and regions
